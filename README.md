# Module 2 Challenge

# VBA Scripting

# VBA script contained in .xlsm filed named "Mod_2_VBA_Script".

# Originally supplied data filed that VBA script references named "Multiple_year_stock_data".  After testing and running script which wrote to this file to replicate results in assignment images I deleted the results to return file to its original condition.  

# Before I deleted results on original filed I resaved the file with the final results as "Multiple_year_stock_data - Post Script Run" in case it needs to be reviewed.

# There is also a MS Word document with screens shots of quarterly tabs and a PDF version of the Word document.
